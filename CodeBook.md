=================

The script run_analysis.R performs all the 5 steps explained in the course project. The script downloads and unzips the dataset and required files are fed and read into different variables.

1. Similar data are merged using rbind() function. e.g. Training and test data of X, Y and subject are merged.
2. Columns with meaures MEAN and STANDARD DEVIATION are extracted from the dataset. Appropriate names are updated from `features.txt` file in the obtained dataset.
3. From the `activity_labels.txt` file, corresponding activites are updated in the dataset. (Available activites are:  WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING).
4. Dataset is labeled in a descriptive way:
	- `tBodyAcc-mean()-X` becomes `timeBodyAccMeanX` 
	- `tBodyAcc-std()-Y` becomes `timeBodyAccStdY`
	- `fBodyAcc-mean()-Z` becomes `freqBodyAccMeanZ`
	- `fBodyBodyGyroMag-mean()` becomes `freqBodyGyroMagMean`
	- `fBodyBodyGyroJerkMag-meanFreq()` becomes `freqBodyGyroJerkMagMeanFreq`
5. Independent tidy dataset with mean value for each subject and activity is generated. The output file is `tidy_data.txt` and is available in this repo.

##Description of Variables
1. data_test_X, data_test_Y, data_train_X, data_train_Y, data_test_subject and data_train_subject contain the data from the downloaded files.
2. data_all_X, data_all_Y and data_all_subject merge the previous datasets mentioned in 1.
2. data_features contains the file `features.txt`. mean_std contains all the columns having literal 'mean' or 'std'. 
3. data_activities contains the file `activity_labels.txt`. Correct activity name is updated from here.
4. all_data merges data_all_X, data_all_Y and data_all_subject into a single dataset. Comprehensive names are updated in the dataset.
5. And finally, avg contains the corresponding averages which is finally stored in `tidy_data.txt` file.
